**Have you read the [FAQ](https://bit.ly/ShakaFAQ) and checked for duplicate open issues?**:

**What version of Shaka Player are you using?**:

**Can you reproduce the issue with our latest release version?**:

**Can you reproduce the issue with the latest code from `master`?**:

**Are you using the demo app or your own custom app?**:

**If custom app, can you reproduce the issue using our demo app?**:

**What browser and OS are you using?**:

**What are the manifest and license server URIs?**:
<!-- NOTE:
  You can send the URIs to <shaka-player-issues@google.com> instead,
  but please use GitHub and the template for the rest.
  A copy of the manifest text or an attached manifest will **not** be
  enough to reproduce your issue, and we **will** ask you to send a
  URI instead.  You can copy the URI of the demo app to send us the
  exact asset, licence server, and settings you have selected there.
